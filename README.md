# Real Estate Valuation with GUI
In this project I have created a machine learning model to predit house prices of a certain area using multiple-regression 
and gradient descent algorithm. Along with it a GUI was also built using which you can input data to get predictions. 
## Dataset
Data for training and testing was taken from UCI ML Repository.
